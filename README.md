Now, just by having experience you will be able to regenerate, not right away, but little by little, a certain amount of health, for a small cost, which would be the experience you accumulate, don't worry that everything will run out, no It will take away a lot, just worry about having it.

 

Are you afraid of dying your first night or in a battle? For that this mod is created, with which you can regenerate yourself to continue battling with enemies, now surviving will no longer be such a difficult problem.
